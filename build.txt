# Generator
============

Currently, only a Visual Studio 2019 solution is offered, in vs_build

# Dependencies
===============

## Ogre Next

The solution expects to find an Ogre Next 2.2 installation under "ext/Ogre" (can be a symbolic link), including the "OgreMain/include" folder. 

The user will also need to prepare a folder "build", and under it "lib", "bin", and "include" (OgreBuildSetting.h) folders with the appropriate dependencies for using Ogre Next. Information on how to acquire all those dependencies can be found here: http://wiki.ogre3d.org/Building+Dependencies.

## SDL2

The solution expects to find a SDL2 installation under "ext/SDL2" (can be a symbolic link), with mostly the "include" folder.

The user will also need to prepare a "bin" folder, containing folders for each supported platform (ex: "x64"), and in each platform, a folder for each configuration (ie: "Debug" and "Release"), each containing the library object files (ex: .dll and import .lib on Windows).
