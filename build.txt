Currently, only a Visual Studio 2019 solution is offered, in vs_build

The solution expects to find an Ogre Next 2.2 installation under ext/Ogre (can be a symbolic link)
The Ogre installation should have a folder "build" with "lib", "bin", and "include" (OgreBuildSetting.h) folders with the appropriate dependencies for using Ogre Next
